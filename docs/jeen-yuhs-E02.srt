00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,851
{\an8}[Kanye] I'm still working.

321
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,610
[humming]

322
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,406
- [dentist 1] Why are you filming?
- [Coodie] This is my documentary.

323
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,409
[dentist 1] No. We're gonna take
the wires out for you, right?

324
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,119
- Yeah.
- You're gonna film that?

325
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,286
Yeah, what's wrong?

326
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,455
- [chuckles] You cannot do that.
- Why not?

327
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,915
- No. Because...
- It's illegal?

328
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,833
[dentist 1] Yeah.

329
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,543
For real?

330
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,213
Your jaw surgery should not be, um…

331
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:50,384
cannot be done until your jaw heals,
which takes a couple of months.

332
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,219
[Kanye] You told me three weeks last time.

333
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,804
No. I did not say…

334
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,766
Three weeks is…
Well, I mean, it's healed in terms of…

335
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,605
It is sticking. But it's not healed enough
to rebreak the jaw to fix the teeth.

336
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,275
You see what I'm saying?

337
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,609
[Kanye] All right.

338
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,945
- You're not "healed" healed.
- Yeah.

339
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,823
In my opinion,
you should have physical therapy

340
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,826
to get the jaw mobilized. That is job one.

341
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,747
Because, unfortunately,
your jaw is broken way up high here.

342
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,789
- All right.
- Okay?

343
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,418
So if you don't mobilize it,
it's gonna get stuck.

344
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,336
Let me see your bite.

345
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,547
Let me just take a bite.

346
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,760
[Kanye] <i>I, uh…</i>
<i>I have a video shoot in January.</i>

347
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,679
[dentist 1] You have video shoot
in January? Okay.

348
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,681
I was supposed to have one in December,

349
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,892
but will my mouth look somewhat normal?

350
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,103
- Even though my bite is off.
- Well, that is not possible.

351
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,646
That will not be possible.

352
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,611
Bite. All the way.
Good. Keep it like that. Don't open.

353
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,332
[Kanye humming]

354
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,346
[dentist 1] Okay.

355
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,891
You won't be able
to get your jaw fixed in January.

356
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,852
So, you know, I mean…

357
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,980
You can have a video shoot.
You're having one now.

358
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,315
Right?

359
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,609
But I wanna have one when I look good.

360
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,152
- You look pretty good.
- [chuckles]

361
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,362
You look good enough.

362
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,198
I wanna be to my fullest.

363
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,743
- Okay? All right?
- [Kanye] All right.

364
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,746
[Coodie] Your video period
can be a lot of the documentary.

365
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,665
- We could do one...
- "Through the Wire."

366
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,376
What I'm thinking is we do one right now.

367
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:52,172
'Cause, this little… Taking this off
looks like I'm taking the wires off.

368
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,633
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

369
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,593
It look like they putting 'em on.

370
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,722
Yeah. You could put that shot and
that little talking there in the video.

371
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,307
It could show him talking…

372
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,310
Have little excerpts over the chorus part?

373
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,188
- [Coodie] Mmm-hmm.
- [dentist 1] Open a little bit for me.

374
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,774
Believe me. The wider you open,
the less you feel.

375
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,984
Just a little pinch here.

376
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,154
Don't move. Relax. Relax your face.

377
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,910
You okay?

378
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,829
Almost done with the shots. Okay?

379
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,372
[Coodie] "He crying on TV?"

380
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,876
Yeah, crying on TV. What's this? You know?

381
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,255
All your fans expect you not to cry.
Expect you to be brave. You know?

382
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,591
Okay.

383
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,720
Okay. We'll let you rest here for a while.

384
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,015
I have to go, so the other doctor
will take it out for you. Okay?

385
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,808
- [Kanye] That's pretty good.
- [dentist 1] Hmm?

386
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,268
Okay.

387
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,108
[muffled] I can't even talk.

388
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,987
- [Coodie] Damn, your shit numb?
- Mmm-hmm.

389
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,658
[dentist 2] If you feel it,
let me know. Okay?

390
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,121
[grunts]

391
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,376
[speaking indistinctly]

392
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,711
You know what I'm saying?

393
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,840
[Coodie chuckling] No.
We don't know what you're saying.

394
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,930
[dentist 2] It's coming out.

395
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,683
[emotional music playing]

396
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,811
Coming through.

397
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,151
Okay.

398
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,196
- [Kanye] Can I keep these?
- [dentist 2] Yeah.

399
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,366
Why don't we wash them off
and give them to you? All right?

400
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,785
No. My mother wants
to keep the blood on them.

401
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,287
- [dentist 2] Hmm?
- My mama wants to keep the blood on them.

402
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,456
- [dentist 2] What for?
- That's just how she wants them.

403
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,792
- [dentist 2] Who?
- My mama. My mother.

404
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,293
- [dentist 2] Your who?
- My mother.

405
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,962
She saves this stuff.

406
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,553
[Coodie] <i>Feeling like</i>
<i>he had just a small window of time</i>

407
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,722
<i>to get his career to the next level,</i>

408
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:10,936
<i>it was hard for Kanye to face the reality</i>
<i>that his recovery would take so long.</i>

409
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,649
<i>Despite the frustration and pain,</i>

410
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>he was determined to make the best of it.</i>

411
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,948
[indistinct chatter]

412
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,079
Now picture this
with gums around it though.

413
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,664
And then they're fangs.

414
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,375
I'mma fuck this up right here.

415
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,294
[man] That's gonna come off.

416
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,338
- Don't let go when you pull it out.
- That shit was shaked a lot.

417
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,256
[man] Hold on to it.

418
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,674
- Yeah. It ain't gonna pop.
- Whoo!

419
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,342
[indistinct chatter]

420
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,971
Man, we is big ballers.
We go out with the best.

421
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,931
[laughter]

422
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,182
[speaking indistinctly]

423
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,018
- [Coodie] How you doing?
- You guys ready?

424
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,229
Let me get cheese fries
with Cajun fries under the cheese.

425
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,774
With more cheese than normal.
A lot of cheese.

426
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,319
Get me the mashed potatoes
with the country gravy.

427
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,447
And that is all.

428
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,283
I already eaten corn and potatoes today.

429
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,452
Man, I lost a lot of weight. I feel good.

430
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,204
I gotta be lifting
my shirt up around here.

431
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,372
[indistinct chatter]

432
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,583
You know, I lost a lot of weight.

433
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,043
[laughter]

434
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,963
- Let me see.
- [Coodie] Look.

435
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,298
They played a nigga, dawg.

436
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,009
I'm like,
"I'm motherfucking Coodie, nigga."

437
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,303
<i>"Channel</i> motherfucking <i>Zero."</i>

438
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,431
I'm like,
"Nigga, you don't know <i>Channel Zero?"</i>

439
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,767
That motherfucker said, "No."

440
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,143
[laughter]

441
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,353
I said, "Well, I was on BET."

442
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,855
[laughter]

443
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,941
[Kanye] What's this nigga
doing right there?

444
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,236
UCLA students right there.

445
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,655
[Coodie] Let me see.
Y'all see <i>A Beautiful Mind?</i>

446
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,074
[woman laughing]

447
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,409
[indistinct chatter]

448
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,786
[Coodie] Some more cheese?

449
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,871
See, I can't really chew
'cause I was in an accident.

450
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,791
- So they gotta melt this down some more.
- [waitress] Melt it?

451
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,501
[waitress laughing]

452
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,212
[man] Go over there
and get a magazine called <i>Mass Appeal.</i>

453
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,800
Just take your time and fan through it
until you see a full page ad on him.

454
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,051
And then you're gonna realize.

455
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,721
We believe you! [chuckles]

456
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,181
[man] Find out who that dude is,

457
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,767
'cause we want y'all
to get the album when it comes out.

458
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,477
For real.

459
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,857
College students.

460
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,862
[Coodie] Stay in school.
Don't drop out like Kanye did.

461
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:35,705
[Coodie] <i>Since I had gotten to LA,</i>
<i>I barely had time to put my bags down</i>

462
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,874
<i>and we were already on the move.</i>

463
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,211
<i>After the accident,</i>

464
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,797
{\an8}<i>Roc-A-Fella put</i> The College Dropout
<i>on the shelf.</i>

465
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,883
<i>We didn't know when</i>
<i>they were going to release it.</i>

466
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,263
<i>But Kanye was motivated more than ever.</i>

467
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,517
<i>So he called in favors</i>
<i>to at least get the album recorded.</i>

468
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,189
{\an8}[Kanye] We can load it up.
Track number two.

469
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,985
Y'all have the light dimmed or something?

470
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,280
- How do you say it? Kanye...
- Kanye.

471
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,573
- Kanye?
- Yeah.

472
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,700
[man] You got a title for it?

473
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,702
Um… Yeah. Call it "Slow Jamz."

474
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,124
Hey, Foxx.
Tell him what your concept is, Kanye.

475
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,417
- [Jamie] What?
- Here it is.

476
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,336
{\an8}[Kanye] My concept for the song…
They gonna say…

477
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,421
The girls will be like,

478
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,339
"I feel this concept and this rapping."

479
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,632
"But sometimes I need, um…"

480
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,051
"I need some slow shit.
I need some dusties."

481
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,845
- "I need some…"
- [Jamie] Whoo!

482
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,140
- We just got through talking about this!
- That's what I told him.

483
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,018

how we feel about this man at the Roc.

1363
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,773
When he used to come and make his beats,
he used to be like, "Yo, I rap."

1364

I'm not gonna lie,
I never paid much attention.

"Stick to the beats, kid."
You know? That kind of thing?

What I thought he was gonna do

1368
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,785
was make an album
and put a bunch of guests on it.

1369
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,329
But obviously,
he had something different in mind.

1370
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,416
I liked
that he never tried to be like anybody.

1371
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,961
He was intent on being original
and doing things his way.

1372

he's always controlled his own destiny.
