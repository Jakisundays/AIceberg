uh, describe your album?

301
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,845
Hmm…

302
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,765
I feel like
it's a breath of fresh air, 'cause…

303
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,687
For all the people that I've been around
and all the experiences I've been through,

304
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,981
I seen a lot of more shit

305
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:46,528
than a lot of people has seen by the time
they get a chance to actually rap.

306
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:51,325
I have to bring in those elements…
Like, my mother's an English teacher,

307
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,330
um, and she used to, like, cultivate me,
you know what I'm saying,

308
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,458
and instill a lot of shit in me
that needs to be brought up.

309
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:04,213
Even when I rap…
Like my father is, like, a Christian, um,

310
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,632
marriage counselor,

311
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,927
so he'll bring up a lot of the issues
Black people have today.

312

313

that I'm finna come up and take your life.

314
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,769
I'm not gonna rap,
"I'm gonna take your life,"

315
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,564

I don't give a fuck
about the industry, man.

317
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,737
What you need to understand is,
when I do this album,

318
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,490
it's gonna be the realest shit
you ever heard because

319
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,035
if I fucking brick, I could still eat.

320
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,037
I can still make a way for my family.

321
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:41,166
So I'm gonna do my album.
I'll do it the way I fucking want to.

322
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,584
You know what I'm saying?

323
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,586
And with the backing that I get,

324
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,339
I don't think there's a way I could…

325
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,550
I'm not gonna say
there's no way I could fail,

326

but hopefully, with God's blessings…

327

is that when a nigga become great,
people get hate.

That's what makes them so great
is because the hate makes you great.

00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,920
{\an8}Don't worry. I won't…

591
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,589
{\an8}I won't give out no secrets.

592
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,304
You've been in New York for how long?

593
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,388
[Kanye] For a year.

594
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,560
In this year's time that I come out here,

595
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,522
I did a lot of good things.
It's really been a blessing.

596
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,524
God's really opened up the gates.

597
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,360
I had the hustle in me so much,
it was so cooped up,

598
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,153
but I got the opportunity out here.

599
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,863
I was running, man.

600
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,407
I was the type of nigga,
I'd be out here broke.

601
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,576
One time,
I was in the studio with Lil' Kim.

602
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,994
I was out here broke.

603
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,788
I couldn't afford to get in a cab.

604
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,957
They told me Sean wanted me
to play some beats.

605
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,000
This shit was, like, 20 blocks away.

606
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,045
I ran to the studio,
'cause I ain't want 'em to leave

607
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,256
before I got a chance
to play 'em some beats.

608
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,591
I was hungry, man. I am hungry, dawg.

609
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,093
Motherfuckers always talk about,

610
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,179
"What I got.
This nigga, he got this, he got that."

611
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,723
Niggas don't realize I ain't nowhere near.

612
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,559
I might be living y'all American dream,

613
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,936
but I'm nowhere near
where my dream is, dawg.

614
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,857
Man, I got aspirations.
I got big dreams, motherfucker.

615
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,900
All this shit is remarkable to me.

616
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,612
So it's like the Roc and Rawkus.

617
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,030
That's exactly what I am.

618
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,701
I'm, like, definitely
the gap between both of that.

619
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,079
I'm just as much Roc-A-Fella
as I am Rawkus.

620
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,539
- You know?
- Right.

621
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:18,001
Dame Dash, man,
Dame Dash ain't no wack nigga, man.

622
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,087
And then Jay-Z is not just a rapper.

623
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,048
Jay-Z is an icon. He's a mogul.

624
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,176
You could be under Jay-Z
and still be big as hell.

625
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,304
People don't wanna be under a rapper

626
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,222
when they feel like
they really are a star,

627
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,640
which I feel like I am,

628
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,184
but I'mma take advantage
of my opportunities, man.

629
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,812
I'mma meet people.

630
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,190
Man, if people serious
about doing what it is I do…

631
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,652
It's a lot of people, man,

632
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,362
be asking for handouts.

633
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,781
It's like they point fingers.

634
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,325
I know people that's mad at me

635
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,827
'cause I wouldn't
give 'em a beat for free.

636
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,830
Think about it, the mentality.

637
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,792
Niggas got a 40 acres and a mule complex,
feel like the world owe 'em something

638
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,377
'cause they never had nothing.

639
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,421
Just go out and work for your shit.

640
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,924
I wasn't born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

641
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,593
Motherfuckers be like,
"That nigga grew up in the suburbs."

642
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,180
Nigga, I stayed on 79th Street
till I was in high school, nigga,

643
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,723
then I moved to 119th.

644
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,934
And I was never in the suburbs,

645
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,478
I was on 87th Street,
you know what I'm saying?

646
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,772
I wasn't in the street
shooting motherfuckers

647
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,940
'cause I was determined.

648
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,108
I wanted to fucking make it in music.

649
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,320
You gonna hold that against me
'cause I ain't kill nobody?

650
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,239
Nigga, I'm a rapper.
I'm a motherfucking MC, dawg.

651
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,408
I'm a storyteller, man. I'm a songmaker.

652
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,993
I create it, man.

653
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,787
The music, dawg, is me, man.

654
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,914
It ain't representation or nothing else

655
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,208
but what I live every day, you know?

656
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,168
I'm a motherfucking rapper, dawg.

657
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,545
Like, I'm…

658
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,048
Man, like, I'll be out…

659
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,759
Before I had my car,
I used to be walking to the train,

660
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,469
practicing my Grammy speech.

661
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:01,145
Yo, can I use the word "fruition"
in the, um… In the article?

662
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,773
I forgot to use it.
That's my new word, fruition.

663
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,528
Some dreams coming to fruition. [chuckles]

664
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,656
[Al Burton] Yeah, I'll put it in there.
I got it.

no bunch of rappers in Chicago.

888

My man Kanye West documentary,

894
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,193
got a lot of love for him,
one of the best producers in Chicago.

895
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,445
I've been knowing him
since he 13, doing his thing.

896
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,656
He opened it up. He opened it up.

897
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:04,410
We're gonna make some good records
and we're gonna have some fun.

898
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:09,415
No matter what happens after this date
and no matter what's said after this date,

899

you see the root of everything
we're doing here

business and love.

Me and Just,

996
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,644
as far as on the beats,

997
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:45,190
we the producers that everybody
try to mimic or copy.

998
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,402
And what's so crazy about that
is I originally got that style…

999

I went over to No ID's crib
when I was like… 14.

He was like,
"You could sample records sped up."

how to make beats.

that's just a record.

00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:48,855
Yeah.

1036
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,107
It's cold in here.

1037
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,734
You all cold?

1038
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,069
Well, no...

1039
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,529
Welcome, I mean.

1040
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,447
Um, what's your name?

1041
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,366
- Coodie.
- Coodie?

1042
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,493
{\an8}Oh, okay. I'm Donda. What's your...

1043
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,495
{\an8}- [JB] I've met you before.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

1044
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,664
{\an8}- This is my mom.
- Yeah.

1045
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,291
Kanye, you look good.
Oh, I haven't seen this.

1046
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,461
This is really… Now, Kanye, I like this.

1047
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,505
- You like it?
- This is nice!

1048
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,090
Ooh.

1049
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,175
Oh, I really like this, Kanye.

1050
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,218
Look, y'all.

1051
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,055
Now this is a true
bachelorette pad right here.

1052
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,016
This is reduced fat milk, man.

1053

Got the Zinfandel, White Zinfandel.

1056
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,695
Kanye, that's really…
I'm so glad you got that one.

1057
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,990
Because when I was in New York
you know what I was thinking?

1058
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:43,243
It was like, "Oh, Kanye, you went
and got another piece of jewelry."

1059
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,120
"You haven't even bought a house."

1060
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,164
- This is worth not getting a house?
- Yeah.

1061
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,250
[both laughing]

1062
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,962
There'll be houses out there.
This is nice.

1063
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,131
[JB laughing] There'll be houses…

1064
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,048
Isn't it?

1065
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,551
- That is nice. That is beautiful.
- [JB] Very unique.

1066
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:03,680
And you know what? You need an angel
to watch over you, so it's all good.

1067
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:05,974
[chuckles]

1068
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,143
You the man.

1069
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,190
We ain't always used to have this view.

1070
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,151
[Donda] No, no.

1071
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,236
[Kanye] It wasn't like this on 79th.

1072
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,907
When I was three years old.

1073
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,871
[Donda] I like the way you, uh, explained
everything about how long

1074
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,206
it takes people to…
What was that, like, uh…

1075
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,960
Jay-Z to write a rap.
And Scarface too, wasn't it?

1076
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,587
Yeah, and how they do.

1077
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,632
All Jay does is basically
record songs in five minutes,

1078
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,301
and then he makes rappers
come to the studio

1079
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,013
and just play the songs and is like,
"Look what I did this week."

1080
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,640
- Eighteen songs."
- All of his songs?

1081
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:51,478
Yeah, he'll play his songs over and over,
loud, like ear-piercing volumes.

1082
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:55,398
Then he started going in the other room.
I said, "Yo, hold."

1083
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,109
I gotta play you one more beat."

1084
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,278
And the way it was, it was awkward.

1085
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,989
If I played him a wack beat at this time,

1086
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,824
it would have been too awkward.

1087
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,702
'Cause he was like…
this is the last song he gonna play.

1088
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,996
Like, "Dawg, I'll play you one more beat."

1089
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,331
So I put it on.

1090
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,249
He start bobbing his head.

1091
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,210
Then he looked over, he tapped me.

that you really love to do.

that I thought was important.

that come off a little arrogant
even though you're humble,

1167
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,772

1168
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,692
the giant looks in the mirror

So you think I come off too arrogant?

1172
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,289
No. Come off just right
'cause of what's inside

1173
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,958
because you can't be a star
and not be a star.

1174
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,169
You've got to have some oomph about you.

1175
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,087
Don't wanna just go say,

1176
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:50,175
"Oh, I'm just really not all that,
but thank you anyway."

1177
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,886
Nothing like that.
I'm not saying come off like that.

1178
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,639
I think the way you are,
handle yourself, is really just…

1179
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,058
Perfect.

1180
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,561

1332

1333

to y'all the best I can.

1335

1336
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,802
that I'mma make it work, you know?

1337
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:16,055
I know nobody has ever
stood up and said, "Yo, man,

let me actually show you
that there's more than one side to me."

1339
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,770
I don't know if I really believe
in that Gemini stuff,

1340
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:24,689
and the constellations and all that.

1341
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,024
Like, I really believe in God, like…

1342
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:30,319
But I know that there's more
than one side to me.

1343
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,570
I know on one end,

1344
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:35,116
when I get a check-in,
sometimes I'm like,

1345
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,202
"Yo, man, I'm finna go and get this

1346

chain off layaway from Jacob's right now."

1347
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:44,000
I know that I'll go to church
with my grandparents

1348
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,585
and really try to hear what the Word is,

1349
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,380
or what they trying to tell me
or really try to understand

1350
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:54,427
about religion or what do I want to pick,
so I'm confused as a Black man.

1351
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,097
A lot of times, artists come into
the aspect that they not confused

1352
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,683
about who they are,
and you always hear about,

1353
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,478
"Man, I loved the album,
but she a hypocrite or he's a hypocrite."

1354
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,897
Well, I guess that's like
anti-hip-hop, right?

1355
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:10,151
Because hip-hop was always
about frontin', always acting like…

1356
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:13,446
I feel like
that's the Black mentality because

1357
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,741
since we ain't had nothing,
then we get a little something,

1358
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,868
we've got to show it to prove something.

1359
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,245
It's like the concept of
walking in the store,

1360
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,581
you look like a shoplifter
unless you got something on.

1361
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:26,667
You feel like you gotta wear jewelry
to get the same service.

1362
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:30,421
I say in a rap, "Getting green
make you almost white."

1363
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,089
I feel like my album,

1364
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,133
the perspective that I'mma speak from,

1365
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,761
I feel like I'mma bridge the gap.

1366
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,597
I'mma be one that helps
bridge the gap with hip-hop.

1367
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,517
I'm trying to get where I could drop
my last name off my name, you know?

1368
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,061
Seriously. Like…
