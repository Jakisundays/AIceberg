162
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,933
I did his video "Through The Wire."
I did a few things for him,

163

And I've been told
that your buses are out there.

304
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,314
So, Kanye is going to
pause this for a second.

305
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,024
He has to finish his rehearsal,

306
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,526
be at a press conference,
a million other things.

307
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,653
But we wanted to get in
just a few questions.

308
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,947
Any questions for Kanye?

309
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,036
[man] <i>Hey, Kanye, I was wondering,</i>
<i>how are you gonna change hip-hop</i>

310
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,330
<i>with your new next album,</i> Graduation?

311
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,751
Uh. Yeah. I definitely like
this album the best.

312
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,503
One of the things with <i>Graduation,</i>
we're just pushing.

313
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,297
One of the reasons I called it Graduation

314
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,007
is 'cause I feel like, I'm over.

315
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,218
I'm at this point where I can really feel…

316
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,596
You know, it's like,
my mom always taught me

317
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,140
you have to believe it first.

318
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,477
I had to believe
that I can make it into the game first.

319
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,605
That was one of the first things.
And I believed it and willed it.

320
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,524
And they say "overconfident"
like that's a bad thing.

321
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,736
I think overconfident,
maybe that needs to be a bad word.

322
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,197
How can you be overconfident?

323
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,449
You should be overconfident.

324
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,909
You should have more confidence!

325
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,953
People should have
more confidence in themselves.

326
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,664
But, they always say,
people that fade into the gray.

327
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,541
People who put their head down
and act like, "Okay."

328
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,585
You know, you do something really good…

329
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,714
And we supposed to be like,
"Oh, man, that song was dope."

330
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,384
-"Really? You think so?"
-[audience laughs]

331
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,427
And I'm like, "Oh, it's a great album."

332
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,180
"Man, you like that?
You got good taste. I like it too."

333
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,640
"We on the same vibe."

334
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,308
So, that's my thing.

335
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:21,563
Willing to beat the negative perception
that they try to throw

336
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,567
on a confident Black man.
Because they haven't seen that before.

337
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,822
It's almost a mentality
of the slave that's too loud.

338
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,533
"Quiet. Quiet down!"

339
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,159
"Quiet down!"

340
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,538
I'mma tell you how I feel about me.
I am the greatest!

341
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,040
And you should feel that way
about yourself too!

342
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,959
[audience cheers]

343
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,504

and Kanye a hand.

[Coodie] <i>Watching Kanye onstage that day,</i>

346
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,098
<i>it was clear to me how much</i>
<i>Donda's words influenced him.</i>

347
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,766
[reporter] Hey, Kanye.

348
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,979
[Coodie] <i>It was like, the bigger he got,</i>

349
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,315
<i>the more he wanted her around.</i>

350
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:06,817
[man] On three. Right here, guys.

352
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,280
[Coodie] <i>And after all this time,</i>

353

354
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,201
Okay, great.

355
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,662
What was the importance
of education in your family?

356
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:23,459
Although Kanye is "the college dropout,"
he dropped in doing something else.

357
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,337
And he very much supports anybody
who wants to go to college.

358
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,548
Have you stopped being a mom?

359
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,593
Are you totally converted
into a business manager now?

360
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,972
[Donda] Yeah. The mom part
is friendship and discussions.

361
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,474
And parenting is over.

362
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,477
People say it turned out okay, so…

363
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,814
Whatever you put your mind to,
just never give up.

00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:01,997
[Donda] Okay.

Some very sad news to report.
The mother of rapper Kanye West has died.

391
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,015
She was just 58 years old.

394
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,531

00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,387
Here.

818
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,764
-[Greg] Are you proud of--
-You see me flash you?

819
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,057
Y'all see me flash you?

820
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,393
You know what it is, bruh!

821
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,311
Coodie! You know what it is!

822
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,357
[laughter]

823
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,442
[Kanye] What's up, baby? We got you.

824
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,236
My brother. What's up, man?

825
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,990
[Greg] Lordy! This is good! This is good
right here! This is good right here.

826
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,243
This is good right here.
They don't know what this is right here!

827
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,248
[Coodie] <i>With everything he had</i>
<i>just gone through,</i>

828
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,792
<i>it was so good</i>
<i>to see Kanye happy and healthy.</i>

829
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,462
<i>It had been so long</i>
<i>since we really connected.</i>

830
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,341
<i>And this reunion</i>
<i>felt like a new beginning.</i>

831
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,266
<i>For years,</i>
<i>I thought the documentary was over.</i>

832
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,938
<i>But now I saw</i>
<i>that there was more of Kanye's story</i>

833
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:29,982
<i>that I could tell.</i>

834
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,907
[Greg] I personally think you're zoned in
more than ever right now, though.

835
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,826
Like, the now…

836
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,661
Like we're talking about the now.

837
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,331
Everything that happened
over probably the last…

838
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,500
You know,
leading up over the last seven months.

839
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,170
I just look at everything,
how things is moving.

840
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,714
We have to embrace our now,

841
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:58,218
to be able to work with
and surround yourself with the people

842
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,264
who create
the most meaningful things on the planet.

843
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,600
You know, we only got 100 years here.

844
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,228
So we gotta go after it,

845
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,023
while it's our time.

846
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,488

This new album, this shit is gonna be…

896
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,679
Like, I like the fact
that he wants it to be positive

897
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,265
and about all these things
that we're touching on,

898
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,809
like suicide, and death and ghosts.

899
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,811
Those are topics that I can get into.

900
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,812
[Greg] Right.

901
00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,943
You know, when he starts getting all like,

902
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,695
the braggadocious shit and like that shit,

903
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,738
I can't hang.

904
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,449
-[Greg laughs] Right.
-I can do it, but I can't hang.

905
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,742
[Greg] Yeah, right.

906
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,829
I'm like, "Man, can't nobody do it
as good as you, man."

907
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,790
[Kanye] It's better for us
to touch on things

908
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,293
that people can really relate to
and feel like they're going through.

909
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,965
And even me, when I already had the house

910
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,175
and the wife and the kids and the plaques,

911
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,426
all the stuff and shit,

912
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,763
would still have moments
where I felt like, suicidal.

913
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:33,141
Here, still have moments
where I'm addicted to Percocets

914
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,768
and don't even realize it.

915
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,520
-You know what I'm saying?
-[Kid] Right.

916
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,397
So… Yeah.

917
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,148
-[Kid] Yeah.
-Yeah.

918
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,609
-[Kid] Chasing ghosts.
-[Coodie] But we here now.

919
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,194
[Coodie] The here and now.

920
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,786
[Coodie]<i> After the year Kanye had had,</i>

921
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,747
<i>it felt important to focus</i>
<i>on what was in front of us.</i>

922
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,877
<i>But now that we had</i>
<i>the opportunity to sit and talk,</i>

923
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,297
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to be there for him as a brother.</i>

924
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,302
<i>I wanted to try and understand</i>
<i>what was on his heart.</i>

925
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,138
[Kanye] I was confused.

926
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,974
Didn't know where I was going.

927
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,183
Hit a breaking point.

928
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,854
You come out of it, think you could.

929
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,272
[Coodie] Mm-hmm.

930
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,693
Sometimes God gotta sit you down
to wake you up.

931
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,486
You know what I'm saying, though?

932
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,032
"Hey, I'mma put you down,
I'mma wake you right back up, man."

933
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,784
"Let's move in the right direction."

934
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,998
I feel that anybody in the past

935
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,793
that has been in a position
of influence, like that I'm in,

936
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:46,173
has, you know, made Versailles.

937
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:53,347
I'm not satisfied
with anything less than the best.

938
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,808
Because time is fleeting.

939
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,854
We do this research.
We're in China right now.

940
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:05,025
We're scouring the globe
to find the best factories,

941
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,152
to work with the best designers.

942
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,658
And people haven't even seen our best yet.

943
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,911
We… We just scratching the surface.

944
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,331
I feel like it needs to be
more organic to be a Yeezy.

945
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,833
And not so curved like…

946
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,335
-Not so… [growls]
-Like…

947
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,923
I kinda don't like the way
this kicks to the front, right there

948
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,633
-because he needs to…
-Soften it up?

949
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,592
Yeah.

950
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,681
Like, I like this fleece so much less
than my ability fabrics.

951
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,224
So much less than Season 4.

952
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,558
Like, I hate digressing.

953
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,146
See, that's what makes the 700 so scary.

954
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,440
That it's like, bulky.

955
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,150
Like, I'm like…

956
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,820
thirty-five pounds overweight

957
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,906
due to medication
that I have to fucking take, right?

958
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,201
But I still have the aspiration
when I look down at my feet

959
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,828
of being super slim and shit,

960
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,539
how it was like when I was on tour.

961
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:04,584
Why couldn't the 700 have been
engineered to be like this?

962
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,714
Where it's like, slim, but like…

963
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,968
Flows out in the right places.

964
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,386
And very purposefully.

965
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:18,265
-[woman] Yeah. It's way less organic.
-That's what I'm saying.

966
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,999
Hello. How are you doing?

967
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,501
What's up? How are you?

968
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,170
-Long time.
-[Kanye] Yes, sir.

969
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:52,924
When we met before, you said
you want to go into the fashion scene.

970
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,219
-Mm-hmm.
-But, uh, twisting for the fashion scene.

971
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,596
-Yeah.
-Right?

972
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,265
I wanna twist it all up, yeah.

973
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,433
[chuckles] Everything.

974
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,102
-Huge hit, right?
-Yeah.

975
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,353
-Jeen-Yuhs.
-Thank you.

976
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,230
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

977
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,069
[Coodie] <i>Moving around with Kanye,</i>

978
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,323
<i>watching him work up close again,</i>

979
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,616
<i>was inspiring.</i>

980

982
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,046
Okay, so, I follow you.

983
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,467
[Coodie]<i> And for him, it seemed to be</i>

01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,859
[Mike] You know what'd be cool
to put out there? Is like, a church.

1301
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,694
Where you have Sunday Service?

1302
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:00,696
[all speaking indistinctly]

1303
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,041
Have you guys… Maybe you guys…

1304
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,460
Have you guys ever been
locked up in handcuffs

1305
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,796
and put into a hospital because
your brain was too big for your skull?

1306
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,506
-[David] No, I haven't.
-Okay. I have.

1307
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,383
-[David chuckles]
-All right, so…

1308
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,843
Next conversation.

1309
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,011
[both chuckle]

1310
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:30,267
What you guys made here is the idea.

1311
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:36,941
But then there's like, one or two
crazy motherfuckers on the planet

1312
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,359
that take it to this.

1313
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,027
What we have over there…

1314
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:45,241
Don't play around. It's not a game.

1315
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,827
Two years of studying with Turell,
two years with Claudio.

1316
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,998
Foster's on the project, off the project.
Ando's on the project, off the project.

1317
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:53,916
[exclaims]

1318
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,127
This right here. Trash.

1319
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:01,507
Trash. <i>Basta.</i> It's finished.

1320
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,220
I don't care if it has a tag of mine.

1321
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:07,554
-[Bryan] Yeah.
-[exclaims]

1322
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:08,639
[Coodie chuckles]

1323
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:09,598
Look at this.

1324
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,142
This is barely edible.

1325
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,852
[all chuckling]

1326
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,437
Yeah, it's not good.

1327
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,106
What a waste of talent.

1328
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,902
I'm saying that in the most humble way,
but at a certain point, it's like…

1329
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,988
-Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan.
-[David] Yeah.

1330
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,739
So, we got to…

1331
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:28,951
[Coodie] <i>As the conversation went on,</i>

1332
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,036
<i>the more the energy shifted.</i>

1333
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,080
It's not a game.

1334
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,666
I go to the hospital for this.

1335
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,293
I take medica…

1336
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:41,714
I took bipolar medication last night
to have a normal conversation,

1337
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,882
and turn alien to English.

1338
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,259
So, what we talking about?

1339
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:51,348
I do not communicate in a way
that people understand in public,

1340
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,643
because it's just truth,
and we're in a world of lies.

1341
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:59,815
There's an execution style
that was performed on me

1342
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:04,862
over the past six-seven years,
post Taylor Swift,

1343
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,656
where they tie one arm…

1344
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,452
both arms, both legs, to four horses.

1345
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,787
All in different directions.

1347
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,626
[Kanye] They didn't know
they was dealing with Deadpool though.

1348
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:22,046
-Deadpool.
-[Bryan] Really?

1349
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,840
[Kanye] Those limbs grew back.

1350

[Coodie]<i> I had never captured</i>

1352
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,685

Basically, we're…

This is something you might deal with,

a million times what I want.

1401
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,480
And it's subtly crushing
my soul and my ego

1402
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:29,191
and my respect and my dignity as a boss.

[Rick]<i> Really?</i>

1426
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,144
-[Kanye] Uh, no pressure.
-[Rick] <i>Let me figure it out.</i>

1427
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:50,897
<i>No, of course. Let me figure out</i>

<i>then I'd do that on Sunday instead.</i>

<i>move things around to do that.</i>

1430
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:59,656
-[Kanye] Okay.
-[Rick]<i> Great. Couldn't be more excited.</i>

1431
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,657
Mm.

1432
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:03,035
[Kanye] I always tell people this,

1433
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,329
that when I do the dictionary game,

1434
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:09,166
you know, the word "excited"
has a bit of negativity in it.

1435
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:11,418
If someone gave you
a brand-new airplane…

1436
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,963
[chuckles] and they told you
it was across the street,

1437
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,924
or if someone gave you a new car,
told you it was across the street,

1438
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:20,927
you might run so fast
that you get hit by a car,

1439
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,554
trying to get to your new car.

1440
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,098
So, that's the reason
why I would say "energized."

1441
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,016
[Rick] <i>I see.</i>

1442
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,518
Because even with Black culture
and woke culture,

1443
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,771
they try to just excite us so much.

1444
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:33,273
We get so excited about this,
excited about that.

1445

-So…

-I'm learning the Zen vibes.
-[Rick] <i>I like it.</i>

1447
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,695
-Yeah.
-[Rick]<i> It's a good word.</i>

1448
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:39,863
Yeah.

1449
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:43,533
All right. Well, I wasn't saying that
to correct you. I was just saying…

1450
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,411
[Rick]<i> No, I appreciate it.</i>
<i>I like listening, I like to learn.</i>

1451
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,581
Yeah. All right, well… Love you, brother.

01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:37,754
<i>♪ And I ain't really seen that woke</i>
<i>You see… ♪</i>

1460
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:38,755
Stop it.

1461
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:42,759
Now I know we got to rewrite
some of the parts to this song

1462
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,470
'cause I want it to be all positive.

1463
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,223
<i>♪ Remind me that don't define me… ♪</i>

1464
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:49,141
So…

1465
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,727
Uh…

1466
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:55,188
I wanna do…
Instead of saying what doesn't define you,

1467
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:56,815
what does define us?

1468
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,317
'Cause, "Remind me that don't define me,"

1469
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:00,569
it has negatives in it.

1470
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:03,739
Like, "A mind is a terrible thing
to waste." We grew up on that.

1471
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:09,327
Think about what they said though.
"A mind is a terrible thing to waste."

1472
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:13,123
You know what I'm saying?
So you got to be really mindful of…

1473
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:14,458
So, how do we… 'Cause…

1474
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,627
<i>♪ God, we'll always follow your lead ♪</i>

1475
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:18,628
That's great.

1476
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:22,299
But, "Remind me that don't define me,"
it's already saying,

1477
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:27,971
"Man, deplorable. Y'all trying to make me
look crazy for crying about abortion."

1478
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,306
Now I'm a crazy man.

1479
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:31,725
Now everybody calling me,
"I hope you're okay."

1480
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:33,226
Man, the world ain't okay,

1481
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,603
sick motherfuckers.

1482
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,731
If somebody say,
"I just got an abortion," on TV,

1483
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:40,192
y'all will be like,
"Oh, man, that's cool."

1484
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,736
If I said that my dad
almost aborted Kanye West

1485
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:45,614
and Kanye West almost aborted North West,
and I'm crying about it,

1486
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:48,408
you wanna make me look like
I'm motherfucking crazy.

1487
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,495
And it doesn't matter.

1488
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,039
For two years,
they tried to say I wasn't a billionaire.

1489
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,302
[Coodie]
My young brother. Everybody know him.

1490
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,889
Some people even worship this man.
But he's a real person

1491
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,183
that is going through something.

1492
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,769
And you could say whatever, but…

1493
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,022
All I got to say, man, is, uh, we praying.

1494
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:22,442
We're going to keep praying.
I know God, he's protecting us.

1495
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:25,612
He always has. You know,
growing up in the hood,

1496
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:30,492
he always kept his force field around me
and my family and my friends.

1497
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:31,868
And, you know…

1498
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:35,872
And I know my father
and Donda is up in heaven right now…

1499
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:38,542
[voice breaks] Um…

1500
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,716
Looking down and, uh…

1501
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:49,511
[stumbling] <i>And…</i>

1502
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,348
And hugging us tight.

1503
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,026
[Kanye] I'm feeling good.

1504
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,612
We just came to San Francisco.

1505
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,948
Do you remember
when we were in the Dominican,

1506
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,993
that house we went to?
And it had those really nice bowls?

1507
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:16,872
-[Kanye's father]<i> Nice what?</i>
-Those nice bowls

1508
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,958
at the house we went to
in the Dominican, the other house.

1509
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,879
Remember the second house we went to?

1510
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:26,798
We were on the beach at the other house,

1511
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,216
the other location, right?

1512
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,386
-[music playing on stereo]
-[Kanye] Come on, bro. Stop that, man.

1513
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,681
-I'm talking to my dad. Chill.
-[man 1] He got it, Kanye.

1514
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:37,601
-[Kanye] Why you doing that, man?
-[man 2] I lost memory or something.

1515
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:38,894
-[music stops]
-<i>What about it?</i>

1516
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:42,606
What I'm saying, is I'm pulling up to
the artist's studio that made those bowls.

1517
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:46,109
-[Kanye's father]<i> Oh, okay.</i>
-It's very relaxing, very soothing.

1518
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:49,487
Very stress-free for me. [chuckles]
It's very fun.

1519
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:52,115
<i>And you're in San Francisco?</i>

1520
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:55,410
Yeah. I'm in San Francisco,
but we're going back to Cody tonight.

1521
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:57,203
[Kanye's father] <i>Okay.</i>

1522
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,289
<i>All right, well…</i>

1523
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:01,708
<i>You're doing okay, right?</i>

1524
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,794
Yeah. Um, how do you feel?

1525
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,465
<i>I feel good. I'm just concerned about you.</i>

1526
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,051
Yeah. Well, you know…

1527
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:14,137
When you go out
and say things like, "No abortion,"

1528
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,764
you know how the media is going to be.

1529
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:18,308
That's a very strong, Christian statement.

1530
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:20,477
And Christians are scrutinized

1531
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,482
and killed for our beliefs
and following the word of God, you know?

1532
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:27,108
And I stand up for what…

1533
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,612
I use my voice
and I won't not use my voice.

1534
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:35,200
Uh… Because my voice is actually
more powerful than even my finances.

1535
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,535
So, they can't control me
with finances.

1536
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,163
[man] That's deep.

1537
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:45,377
[Kanye's father]<i> I'm just saying,</i>
<i>write your speech next time, Kanye.</i>

1538
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,045
Okay.

1539
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,838
[Coodie] Pop, we got him. He good now.

1540
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,131
Man, hold on one second.

1541
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,884
My dad don't even remember you.
What're you saying?

1542
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,470
-[Coodie] But if he asks, we got you.
<i>-What'd he say?</i>

1543
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:56,763
He said, "Pop, we got him."

1544
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:59,224
That's one of my best friends,
I've known for 30 years,

1545
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,226
that's in the car with me right now.

1546
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:02,268
<i>All right.</i>

1547
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,062
[Coodie] He's like my little brother.

1548
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,480
Yo, let's write it next time.

1549
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:08,066
[man] I'll write the speech
before you say something.

1550
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:11,569
You know what I'm saying?
The first time I rode a bike, I fell.

1551
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,363

1552
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:15,949
[Kanye's father] <i>Okay.</i>

1553
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,286
I'mma get to the point
of popping wheelies.

1554
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:22,831
<i>All right.</i>

1555
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:25,959
You remember by the time
I used to learn how to ride a bike,

1556
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:28,211
I was riding on top of the handlebars.

1557
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:31,673
But when we were in Atlanta
and we went down that hill,

1558
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:33,800
riding that bike. I remember that.

1559
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,469
-Yes. Yeah.
<i>-You fell for the first time.</i>

1560
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:39,597
The first time I fell was by the time…
[continues indistinctly]

1561
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,600
I was riding on the handlebars.

1562
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:47,063
[Kanye's father] <i>But you also remember</i>
<i>I ran beside you to keep you up?</i>

1563
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,982
[Kanye] Well, I need you beside me.

1564
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:52,068
<i>-All right. I'll let you go do your thing.</i>
-Okay. We'll talk soon.

1565
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,695
-Hey. How are you?
-Hi!

1566
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,739
-I love your pants.
-So nice to see you.

1567
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,490
-[Kanye] Good to see you too.
-Come on in.

1568
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:00,452
-[Kanye] This is my dad over here.
-Hi!

1569
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,871
Oh! Hi! Show him the studio.

1570
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:05,498
[Kanye] Yeah. Look at the studio.
Look at what she makes.

1571
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,625
-[Tina] Hi, everybody. Come on in.
-[man] Hello.

[indistinct chatter]

1573
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,507
[Kanye] We flew all the way to see her.
She makes these from scratch, herself.

1574
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:17,594
It's beautiful. Oh, wow, this is nice.

1575
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,055
We know how to do it now.

1576
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,015
[Coodie]
Hey, let me say "peace" to your pops.

1577
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:24,934
Peace. How you doing, Pops?
How's it going, man?

1578
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,478
This is Coodie, man.

1579
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,731
Yes, sir. I've been around with Ye
from the beginning, brother.

1580
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:32,108
Yes, sir. Pleasure. Pleasure.

1581

Respect to you. Yes, sir.

1582
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:37,614
He did the "Through the Wire" video.
He did a bunch of it. First documentary.

1583
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:39,240
He's got some good videos.

1584
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,534
Yo, let's send what you made to my dad.

1585

-[Coodie] Coodie.

-I say, "Cody," but that is Coodie.

-[Coodie] C-O-O-D-I-E.

So, got it. It's "Coo" not "Co."
Got it. Okay.

1593
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:00,136

We have to beat Apple. We have to beat
Disney and Ford, but we'll make it,

1597
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:15,110
because of our connections with Adidas,
our connections with GAP,

1598
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,821
but, more than anything,
our connection with God.

1599

that's coming together,

1600

it's going to change education,
change sanitation, change meditation,

01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,624
change the way we think
and connect with Earth,
